TIY Week 1, Day 4: Swamp Rabbit Cycling CSS Project
## Lay out a website to provided spec

Dan Dietz, the proud owner of 'Swamp Rabbit Cycling', needs you help. The person designing his page has gone AWOL. He needs this page looking great by the end of day and his friend Joel recommended you. Your job is to take the existing HTML and style it to match the awesome mockup.

Instructions  
Style the given HTML to match the 'Swamp Rabbit Cycling' mockup.

Font-face instructions
For this project you will need to use two @font-face at-rules.

Hint  
Like in previous activities, figure out the general layout first. What's the height of the header and the images section?

The width of the mockup is 1280px.
